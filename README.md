# Where to Start with Microsoft Films

Author: Austin Collins

## Overview

This project aims to determine what Microsoft's first steps can be when making a film for the first time. I take data from The Numbers, a movie industry finance website, and IMDb. Analzing this data shows what a good minimum budget is for a major motion picture, which genres of film are most profitable in recent years, and which actor to hire for the lead role in this new film.

## Business Problem

Competitors of Microsoft are making millions of dollars per year with their film projects, and now Microsoft wants to get in on the action. They can do so, and certainly have the money to make similar large productions, but first they need to know how to ensure that their movies will be profitable.

## Data

Information about major motion pictures that were released since 2010 was pulled together for analysis. Information included release date, genre, production budget, domestic revenue, and worldwide revenue.

Further information about the financial success of movies for various actors was included. This included the actor's name, number of films they appear in as the lead role, and how much gross revenue those movies have made in total.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, including correlations between budgets and revenues. I also caluclate the return on investment for each movie, and find the average gross revenue of movies in which a given actor was the lead. All correlations and relationships aim to discover what is most likely to make Microsoft's movies profitable. 

## Results

The average proudction budget for a film since 2010 was $32.6 million. $32 million is a good base level for Microsoft to spend, because the average is far above the median, meaning that the films made by other major studios like Sony and  Disney made up most of all the money spent. To be in competition with these major studios, Microsoft will have to spend a sizeable amount of money.

Thankfully, movies with higher production budgets tend to have higher gross revenue. 

The chart below comapres the prodcution budgets and gross revenue of movies that spent at least $32 million on their production.

However, Microsoft wants to make a profit, not just a higher gross revenue. To put the odds in their favor, they can make a movie that is a musical, or any of the other top options.

Beyond that, we know that having a well-known actor can help make a movie more popular. To help choose which popular actor Microsoft should hire, I compared lead actors to the average gross domestic revenue of the films they starred in (minimum of 10 films). The top option in this case is Sebastian Stan.

## Conclusions

There are three major takeaways from the data above:

1. Spend at least $32 million on the prodcution budget of the movie in order to make a competitive product
2. Make a musical, as that kind of film makes the most profit on average
3. Hire Sebastian Stan as the lead actor, since his movies tend to make the most revenue

## Next Steps

Further analysis could yield insights on how to make a film studio produce multiple fan-favorite movies. Things to consider could include types of IPs that lead to multiple films rather than stand-alone projects, how well-recieved sequels of movies typically are, and whether or not using an existing IP to create a story would help profitability.
